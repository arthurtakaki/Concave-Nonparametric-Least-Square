# Concave-Nonparametric-Least-Square
Concave Nonparametric Least Square for efficiency analysis

This repository aims to create a model to calculate the frotier of efficiency using Concave Nonparametric Methods.

It will starts with the simple calculation, than going to explore the possibility to reduce the number of constraints.
